# A public recruitment warm-up project
A project that will serve as a recruitment application. Why warming up? This is the first time I have used [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) service. I needed to do a small project that will show me how to use this site (merging the project with GitHub and local implementation).

# Dependencies
In [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Yrazec/nn-recruitment-project/blob/main/requirements.txt) you can find list of dependencies that will be necessary to run the project.

# Importants
- The project is not an independent application that can be run from the CLI. The project works closely with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) service. A link to work with LIVE version of this project can be found here: [nn-recruitment-project ∙ main ∙ streamlit_app.py](https://yrazec-nn-recruitment-project-streamlit-app-n0sziz.streamlitapp.com/).
- The project is a short, warm-up implementation, no magic happens here, and no ML/AI/DL functionalities are used.

## Structure
Project contains 3 important files:
- [streamlit_app.py](https://github.com/Yrazec/nn-recruitment-project/blob/main/streamlit_app.py) - Runner file for K-Means wrapped in GUI.
- [/gui/gui.py](https://github.com/Yrazec/nn-recruitment-project/blob/main/gui/gui.py) - File for storing Graphical User Interface feature.
- [/libs/k_means.py](https://github.com/Yrazec/nn-recruitment-project/blob/main/libs/k_means.py) - File for storing K-Means feature.

# Content
The project implements the K-Means algorithm in several hundred lines of code. The K-Means algorithm clusterize selected points into possibly equal clusters with relative nearest centers. Both the number of centers and the number of entry points are parameters.
